## What's Ready for Next Phase

### Established Foundation
1. **Project Structure**: Complete directory structure ready for development
2. **Configuration System**: Robust, production-ready configuration management
3. **Logging**: Enterprise-grade logging with file rotation and structured output
4. **Data Models**: Complete type-safe models for all core entities
5. **Testing**: Basic testing infrastructure and validation

### Ready Components
- All source directories created and ready for implementation
- Database models ready for schema creation
- Configuration system ready for API keys and service integration
- Logging system ready for all components

## Next Steps - Phase 2: Discovery Engine

With the solid foundation in place, we're ready to move to Phase 2: Discovery Engine:

1. **Database Setup**: Initialize SQLite database with our models
2. **Basic Web Scraping**: Start with simple job board scraping proof of concept
3. **LLM Integration**: Set up Ollama or cloud LLM for basic text processing
4. **Job Extraction**: Build parsers for job descriptions and metadata
5. **Storage System**: Implement job storage and retrieval

## Notes

- The foundation is built to be production-ready from the start
- All configuration options are in place for the full roadmap
- Code is type-safe and follows Python best practices  
- Logging system will provide excellent debugging and monitoring capabilities
- Ready for team collaboration with proper project structure
